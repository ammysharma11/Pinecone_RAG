üìÑ Chat With Your PDF - A RAG-Powered Chatbot
An interactive web application that allows you to have a conversation with your PDF documents. Upload a PDF, and the app will use a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to answer your questions based on the document's content.

‚ú® Features
Interactive PDF Upload: Easily upload any PDF document through a simple web interface.

Dynamic Vectorization: Automatically processes, chunks, and creates vector embeddings for your document's content.

Secure & Isolated Sessions: Each uploaded PDF is stored in a unique, isolated namespace within the Pinecone vector database, ensuring your queries only search against the relevant document.

Conversational Q&A: Ask questions in natural language and receive answers generated by Google's Gemini model, grounded in the context of your PDF.

User-Friendly Interface: Built with Gradio for a clean, responsive, and easy-to-use chat experience.

‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack & Architecture
This project leverages a modern stack to build an efficient RAG pipeline:

Backend & UI: Gradio

Orchestration Framework: LangChain

Vector Database: Pinecone (Serverless)

LLM & Embeddings: Google Gemini API

PDF Parsing: PyPDF

System Flow
The application follows a simple, powerful architecture:

PDF Upload: The user uploads a PDF via the Gradio interface.

Processing & Chunking: The PDF is loaded and split into smaller, manageable text chunks using LangChain's text splitters.

Embedding & Storage: Each text chunk is converted into a numerical vector (embedding) using the Gemini API and stored in a unique namespace in the Pinecone serverless index.

User Query: The user asks a question in the chat interface.

Retrieval: The user's query is embedded, and Pinecone performs a semantic search to retrieve the most relevant text chunks from the document's namespace.

Generation: The retrieved chunks (context) and the user's query are passed to the Gemini LLM, which generates a coherent, context-aware answer.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
You will need API keys for the following services:

Pinecone: Get your API key from app.pinecone.io.

Google Gemini: Get your API key from makersuite.google.com.

Installation
Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git)
cd YourRepoName

Create a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install Dependencies
Install all the required packages from the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set Up Environment Variables
Create a file named .env in the root of your project directory and add your API keys to it:

PINECONE_API_KEY="YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY"
GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"

Note: The application code will need to be configured to load these variables, typically using a library like python-dotenv.


üìñ Usage
Open the application in your web browser.

Click the "Upload PDF" button and select a PDF file from your computer.

Click "Process PDF" and wait for the status message to confirm that processing is complete.

Use the chat interface at the bottom to start asking questions about your document.
